二十世纪以来 史料比较详实 故单列

“用德国的剑，为德国的犁取得土地，为国家取得每日的面包”
出自《我的奋斗》（mein kampf）第一卷第四章《慕尼黑》，整节如下
All alliances, therefore, should have been viewed exclusively from this standpoint and judged according to their possible utilization. If land was desired in Europe, it could be obtained by and large only at the expense of Russia, and this meant that the new Reich must again set itself on the march along the road of the Teutonic Knights of old, to obtain by the German sword sod for the German plow and daily bread for the nation.

太阳下的一席之地 (Platz an der Sonne) 英文指路 -- place in the sun
伯恩哈德·冯·比洛 Bernhard von Bülow 
于1897年12月6日德国国会辩论发表的声明中。他在声明中依据德国当时的殖民政策提出： “....一句话：我们不想动任何人手里的那杯羹，但我们也要属于自己的那太阳下的一席之地。
“In a word: we do not want to relegate anyone to the shadows, but we also demand our place in the sun.”

这个人1897-1900是德国外长 1900-1909是德国总理 
他还有很多名言，但中文版中有一句是杂糅

“We do not at all feel the need to have our fingers in every pot. But we are of the opinion that it is not advisable to exclude Germany at the outset from competition with other peoples in countries that hold promise.”

“The times are past when the Germans left to one of its neighbors the earth, to another the sea, and reserved the sky for itself—when pure doctrine reigned, these times are over. We regard it as one of our most important tasks to promote our shipping interests, particularly in East Asia, and to maintain our trade and our industry.”

杂糅的是这句--“让别的民族去分割大陆和海洋，而我们德国满足于蓝色的天空的时代已经过去了，我们也要求阳光下的地盘”
